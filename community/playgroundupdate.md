# Playground Update

> PLAYGROUND INSTALLATION! Many of you will recall that we had planned a playground installation this spring at the baseball and softball complex, but due to wet weather, it had to be postponed. The playground company was not available until Sat. Nov. 5.
> 
The good news is that since that time, my wife Jeanneane secured another $25,000 and so had enough to purchase ALL of the equipment. This is a handicap accessible playground and will be the only one in Shepherd. She got the idea, after watching kids play on the dirt piles, while their siblings played ball for 5 hours. I am asking for help on Sat. **Nov. 5**. The company says they need 8 crews of 5 people each.

>Basically each group will be responsible for a piece of equipment. Someone from the company will direct us, but we have to turn the wrenches. They will provide all the tools and some ladies from the Rotary Club are going to supply lunch. I am calling in any old favors, as this is a huge undertaking. Many hands make light work. If you could help, please let me know, so I can set up teams. Plan on a start time of 8:30. Jack Nartker
