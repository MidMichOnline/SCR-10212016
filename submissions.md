# Call for Submissions


I am accepting submissions of news stories, commentary, photos, videos, or news tips via the website http;//www.shepherdhistory.org. This will be the new home of the Shepherd Journal but it is also a collaboration with the Shepherd Area Historical Society.

I am building a website where visitors can directly submit articles for review, join discussions, ask questions, submit ads, or add to a community directory. It also has a social aspect where once you become a member you can follow and send private messages to other members.

Everyone is welcomed to take a look, although keep in mind it is still a work in progress. If you would like to learn more, message me on Facebook or contact me at [shepherddigest@gmail.com](mailto:shepherddigest@gmail.com).

I am also looking for members of the community who would be interested in becoming regular contributors to the Shepherd Journal. I am especially in need of photographers, someone who is willing to cover sports. It would be a volunteer position.
