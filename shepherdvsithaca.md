> Just watched the Shepherd /Ithaca game via Facebook thanks to Jay B Gross one hell of a game Shepherd had ithaca scared shitless until a Bullshit call of pass interference..still can't figure that one out the Shepherd defender was 3-4 ft away from the ithaca kid makes me wonder if they've always played that shady? #$$refsinbackpocket$....Troy Opdycke tell Blake I said GOOD JOB!!
